## Is it 1:1?

**No, and never will be**. There are definitely some unintentional differences due to how things are rendered. NIKKE runs on Unity, and this runs on pure HTML, CSS, and JS code with Electron as the overall framework to make it an application.

However, it looks accurate enough to look real in first glance. Look at it deeper than normal and you'd see many imperfections (some intentional). I have a goal of making the two look distinct the longer you look at it.

The accuracy of the tool more leads to the Summer 2024 Version (during BEAUTY FULL SHOT) of the Scenario screen, which I thought looked perfect. There'll be some considerations to Shift Up's design changes going forward.

## Is this meant to misinform/deceive?

**No, that is not my goal**. My goal is to create something better than what the [Dialogue Generator](https://skuqre.github.io/nikke-font-generator/dialogue/) currently is. Like the site, the final product will have watermarks in order to prevent misinformation.

This tool is **only** meant for entertainment. **Never misinformation**. When a watermark is cropped, that is where issues should arise. When you see someone using this to misinform, please report on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikkefontgen/) and help us out!
